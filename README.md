# AspNetCore2CoreUI

This repo contains a standard ASP.NET Core 2.1 MVC Visual Studio 2017 template project with a twist.

The [CoreUI Open Source Bootstrap 4 Admin Template](http://coreui.io/) was adapted to replace the default style, to get a good starting point for an elegant solution for your next project.

This repo goes along with my blog posts:

ASP.NET MVC Core 2.1 + CoreUI v2.0.0

* **ENGLISH:** [Building elegant applications with ASP.NET Core MVC 2.1 and CoreUI 2 (Bootstrap 4)](http://www.coderepo.blog/posts/building-elegant-applications-aspnet-core-mvc-2.1-coreui-2-bootstrap-4/)

ASP.NET MVC Core 1.1 + CoreUI v1.0.4

* **ENGLISH:** [Building elegant applications with ASP.NET MVC Core 2 and Bootstrap 4 using CoreUI](http://www.coderepo.blog/posts/building-elegant-applications-aspnet-mvc-core-2-bootstrap-4-coreui/)

In the blog posts I explain the process of adapting the [CoreUI](http://coreui.io/) template.

I consider this a stepping stone on my way to Javascript front-end development, coming from a C# back-end background.

Hope this can help you too on your way to become a better developer.
